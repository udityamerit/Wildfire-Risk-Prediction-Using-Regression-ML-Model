# ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Risk Prediction Using Regression ML Model

This project performs end-to-end wildfire risk prediction using multiple regression models based on the **Algerian Forest Fires dataset**. It covers complete data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Wildfires have become increasingly frequent and intense, affecting ecosystems and economies. In this project, we use real-world data from Algerian forests to build predictive models that estimate **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**, which indicates the potential for wildfire risk.

We build multiple regression models and compare their performance using standard metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information

- **Source**: Algerian Forest Fires Dataset (UCI Repository)
- **Attributes**:
  - Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind, Rain
  - DC, DMC, FFMC, ISI (fire danger indices)
  - FWI (target variable)
- **Target**: `FWI` (Fire Weather Index â€” numerical value)

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- Combined two region-wise datasets into one
- Converted region column to numerical category
- Converted all columns to appropriate data types
- Handled missing values
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Split into `train` and `test` sets (80:20)

---

## ðŸ¤– ML Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score

---

## âœ… Best Model

After comparing multiple models, **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance based on RÂ² score and lowest errors.
